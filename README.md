# The-Conlang-Dictionary
A dictionary app that allows you to take a word in English and get possible translations in an entered conlang.

## Use
To use, load a dictionary from a file, and then use the textbox below to get a translation of a word either from a source language to a conlang or vice versa. 

If you would like to get the closest word to your string to translate (which I recommend unless you know specific words you've created w/out inflection, so most of the time), simply put a colon at the front of the word you want to translate.
